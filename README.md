The project delves into understanding the reasons behind why some young people in India, aged 5-29, either drop out of school or never enroll in the first place. It pays special attention to how factors like income levels, whether they live in urban or rural areas, gender, and household type influence these educational outcomes. Using data from a 2014 survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), the study aims to estimate how many people have either discontinued their education or never started, and the reasons behind these decisions. By applying a ratio estimator, the study not only estimates these proportions but also looks into the accuracy of these estimates across different socio-economic groups. Additionally, the project uses logistic regression to explore how these educational outcomes are influenced by various socio-economic factors, with a particular focus on comparing the situation in West Bengal to the rest of India.
